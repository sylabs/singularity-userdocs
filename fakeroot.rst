Fakeroot feature
################

********
Overview
********

The fakeroot feature (commonly referred as rootless mode) allows an
unprivileged user to run a container as a **"fake root"** user by
leveraging `user namespace UID/GID mapping
<http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html>`_.

.. note::

   This feature requires a Linux kernel >= 3.8, but the recommended
   version is >= 3.18

A **"fake root"** user has almost the same administrative rights as root
but only **inside the container** and the **requested namespaces**,
which means that this user:

   -  can set different user/group ownership for files or directories
      they own
   -  can change user/group identity with su/sudo commands
   -  has full privileges inside the requested namespaces (network, ipc,
      uts)

*********************
Restrictions/security
*********************

Filesystem
==========

A **"fake root"** user can't access or modify files and directories for
which they don't already have access or rights on the host filesystem,
so a **"fake root"** user won't be able to access root-only host files
like ``/etc/shadow`` or the host ``/root`` directory.

Additionally, all files or directories created by the **"fake root"**
user are owned by ``root:root`` inside container but as ``user:group``
outside of the container. Let's consider the following example, in this
case "user" is authorized to use the fakeroot feature and can use 65536
UIDs starting at 131072 (same thing for GIDs).

+----------------------+-----------------------+
| UID inside container | UID outside container |
+======================+=======================+
| 0 (root)             | 1000 (user)           |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| 1 (daemon)           | 131072 (non-existent) |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| 2 (bin)              | 131073 (non-existent) |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| ...                  | ...                   |
+----------------------+-----------------------+
| 65536                | 196607                |
+----------------------+-----------------------+

Which means if the **"fake root"** user creates a file under a ``bin``
user in the container, this file will be owned by ``131073:131073``
outside of container. The responsibility relies on the administrator to
ensure that there is no overlap with the current user's UID/GID on the
system.

Network
=======

Restrictions are also applied to networking, if ``singularity`` is
executed without the ``--net`` flag, the **"fake root"** user won't be
able to use ``ping`` or bind a container service to a port below 1024.

With ``--net`` the **"fake root"** user has full privileges in a
dedicated container network. Inside the container network they can bind
on privileged ports below 1024, use ping, manage firewall rules, listen
to traffic, etc. Anything done in this dedicated network won't affect
the host network.

.. note::

   Of course an unprivileged user could not map host ports below than
   1024 by using: ``--network-args="portmap=80:80/tcp"``

.. warning::

   For unprivileged installation of {Singularity} or if ``allow setuid =
   no`` is set in ``singularity.conf`` users won't be able to use a
   ``fakeroot`` network.

****************************
Requirements / Configuration
****************************

Fakeroot depends on user mappings set in ``/etc/subuid`` and group
mappings in ``/etc/subgid``, so your username needs to be listed in
those files with a valid mapping (see the admin-guide for details), if
you can't edit the files ask an administrator.

In {Singularity} ``3.5`` a ``singularity config fakeroot`` command has
been added to allow configuration of the ``/etc/subuid`` and
``/etc/subgid`` mappings from the {Singularity} command line. You must
be a root user or run with ``sudo`` to use ``config fakeroot``, as the
mapping files are security sensitive. See the admin-guide for more
details.

*****
Usage
*****

If your user account is configured with valid ``subuid`` and ``subgid``
mappings you work as a fake root user inside a container by using the
``--fakeroot`` or ``-f`` option.

The ``--fakeroot`` option is available with the following singularity
commands:

   -  ``shell``
   -  ``exec``
   -  ``run``
   -  ``instance start``
   -  ``instance run``
   -  ``build``

Build
=====

With fakeroot an unprivileged user can now build an image from a
definition file with few restrictions. Some bootstrap methods that
require creation of block devices (like ``/dev/null``) may not always
work correctly with **"fake root"**, {Singularity} uses seccomp filters
to give programs the illusion that block device creation succeeded. This
appears to work with ``yum`` bootstraps and *may* work with other
bootstrap methods, although ``debootstrap`` is known to not work.

Examples
========

Build from a definition file:
-----------------------------

.. code::

   singularity build --fakeroot /tmp/test.sif /tmp/test.def

Ping from container:
--------------------

.. code::

   singularity exec --fakeroot --net docker://alpine ping -c1 8.8.8.8

HTTP server:
------------

.. code::

   singularity run --fakeroot --net --network-args="portmap=8080:80/tcp" -w docker://nginx
